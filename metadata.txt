qgisMinimumVersion=3.4
description=Computes dispersal areas based on landscape permeability
version=1.1
author=Mathieu Chailloux
email=mathieu@chailloux.org

about=BioDispersal is a QGIS 3 plugin computing potential dispersal areas based on landscape permeability in order to model ecological continuities. It defines a procedure easing data preparation and performing effective dispersal computation. For each subnetwork (for instance grasslands, wetlands, a specific species) :
 - input data is selected, classified and rasterized according to specified extent and resolution
 - rasterized layers are merged
 - friction coefficients are assigned to merged layer classes
 - disperal areas are computed from habitat layer according to friction layer and maximal dispersal capacity
 BioDispersal has been developped by Mathieu Chailloux and Jennifer Amsallem from IRSTEA / UMR TETIS. It has been funded by the French ecological network resource center and French ministry of ecology.
