 Weighting is a way to refine friction layers.
    </p>
    <p>
<i>Weighting mode</i>
 <ul>
    <li> Minimum: result is the minimum value of friction and weighting pixels</li>
    <li> Maximum: result is the maximum value of friction and weighting pixels</li>
    <li> Multiplication: result is the product of  friction and weighting pixels</li>
    <li> Intervals: friction pixel is multiplied by weighting coefficient if ponderation pixel belongs to matching interval, and remains unchanged if no interval matches. This mode is used to perform weighting by slope for instance</li>
    <li> Buffers: friction pixel is multiplied by weighting coefficient if distance to weighting layer belongs to matching interval. Distance to weighting layer is the minimum distance (in meters) to a pixel that is not NoData. This mode is used to perform weighting by distance to roads</li>
 </ul>
